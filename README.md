This project is a personal record of my PyTorch learning journey, based on the book "Dive into Deep Learning." It includes the code and annotations from the learning process.
The **Learning** folder contains the code recorded during the learning process,
while the **YOLO_Pytorch** folder contains the code for attempting to reproduce the YOLOv1 network. So far, I have implemented the loading of datasets in VOC format and defined the YOLOv1 network structure. I will continue to update it in the future.

本项目是个人pytorch学习记录，参考书是《动手学深度学习》，包含学习过程中的代码以及注释。其中Learning文件夹下是学习过程记录的代码，YOLO_Pytorch文件夹下是尝试复现YOLOv1网络的代码，目前实现了加载VOC格式的数据集以及YOLOv1网络结构定义，后续继续更新。
